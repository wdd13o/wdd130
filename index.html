        <p>Hello! My name is Bundu Kallon and I'm from Your Freetown, Sierra Leone, west Africa. I enjoy Coding at BYU Pathway. 
        I'm excited to learn web development in this course. I am an aspiring full-stack developer from Sierra Leone. 
        I'm passionate about creating solutions through code and currently deepening my 
        skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When I'm not coding, you can find me 
        contributing to open-source projects or exploring new technologies. My goal is 
        to build applications that solve real problems in my community while meeting 
        global standards I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I'm excited 
        to be part of this journey through the WDD 330 course. Let's connect and 
        build something amazing together!</p>

        <p>Freetown blends rich history with resilience, reflecting Sierra Leoneâ€™s journey from colonialism to independence (1961) and post-civil war recovery. Its coastal energy, cultural fusion, and symbolic significance make it a unique African capital.</p>
